class Friendship < ActiveRecord::Base
	
	belongs_to :user, class_name: "User", foreign_key: "user_id"
	belongs_to :friend, class_name: "User", foreign_key: "friend_id"
end

Here it will do the relation ships to the friend tables

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	has_many :friends, class_name: "Friendship" 
	belongs_to :user, class_name: "User", foreign_key: "friend_id"
end
//creates the relation ship many to many

class CreateFriendships < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :friendships do |t|
      t.references :friend, index: true

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

User.first.create(friend: User.second)
